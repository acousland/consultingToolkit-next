# Electron Application Structure

## ✅ **Correct Structure (Current)**

Your Electron application is now properly organized following best practices:

```
consultingToolkit-next/
├── 📁 electron/                    # 🆕 Electron main process & packaging
│   ├── 📄 main.js                 # Main Electron process
│   └── 📄 preload.js             # Preload script for security
├── 📁 apps/
│   ├── 📁 backend/               # FastAPI Python backend
│   └── 📁 frontend/              # Next.js React frontend (renderer)
├── 📄 package.json               # Root package.json with Electron config
└── 📁 tools/, docs/, etc.        # Development tools and documentation
```

## **Key Benefits of This Structure:**

### 🎯 **Proper Separation of Concerns**
- **Root Level**: Electron packaging and coordination
- **apps/backend/**: Pure backend logic (FastAPI)
- **apps/frontend/**: Pure frontend logic (Next.js)

### 🔧 **Correct Path Management**
- Electron main process manages both frontend and backend from root level
- Backend paths: `../apps/backend/`
- Frontend build output: `../apps/frontend/out/`
- No cross-directory dependencies

### 📦 **Simplified Build Process**
- Root package.json handles Electron packaging
- Frontend package.json focuses only on Next.js build
- Backend dependencies managed in apps/backend/requirements.txt

## **Available Commands:**

### Development
```bash
# Start backend + frontend for web development
npm run start-dev

# Start Electron app in development mode
npm run electron:dev
```

### Building
```bash
# Build frontend for Electron
npm run build:frontend

# Package Electron app (development)
npm run electron:pack

# Build distributable Electron app
npm run electron:dist
```

### Testing
```bash
npm run test              # Full test suite
npm run test:quick        # Quick validation
npm run validate          # Development checks
```

## **Why This Structure is Correct:**

### ❌ **Previous Problem (Fixed)**
Having Electron packaging in `apps/frontend/` was problematic because:
- Electron needs to manage BOTH frontend AND backend
- Path resolution became complex and error-prone
- Mixed concerns (frontend-specific vs. full-app packaging)

### ✅ **Current Solution**
- **Electron at root level**: Can properly coordinate all components
- **Clear separation**: Each directory has a single responsibility  
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more apps or services
- **Industry standard**: Follows Electron best practices

## **Electron Process Architecture:**

1. **Main Process** (`electron/main.js`): 
   - Manages application lifecycle
   - Creates browser windows
   - Starts/stops Python backend
   - Handles native OS interactions

2. **Renderer Process** (`apps/frontend/`):
   - Next.js React application
   - Runs in Chromium browser context
   - Communicates with main process via IPC

3. **Backend Process** (`apps/backend/`):
   - FastAPI Python server
   - Started/managed by main process
   - Provides API endpoints for business logic

This structure ensures your Electron app can properly package and distribute both the frontend UI and the backend API as a single desktop application! 🚀
