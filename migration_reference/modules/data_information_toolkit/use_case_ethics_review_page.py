   - Magnitude of the harm
   - Likelihood of the harm occurring
   - Assign points: 1-3 (minor), 4-6 (moderate), 7-8 (significant), 9-10 (major)

4. **Utilitarian Calculation**:
   - Total Pro Points: [sum]
   - Total Con Points: [sum]
   - Net Utilitarian Score: [pros - cons]
   - Overall Assessment: Is this use case utilitarian-positive or negative?

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - What assumptions could change the outcome?
   - What uncertainties exist in the analysis?

Be objective and thorough. Consider both short-term and long-term consequences."""
